For users that are using IE6 or IE7, this widget will display a reminder for them to upgrade to a newer version or install an alternative browser.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you the ability to display a widget to your visitors that use IE6 (and optionally IE7), reminding them to upgrade their browser!  It can display a link to download the current versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, or Internet Explorer â€” entirely up to you which of the five are offered to the user, and whether the order is randomized on each page load.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `no-ie` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Position the widget the desired sidebar through the `widgets` admin page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is IE6 bad? =

Due to a lack of support for most modern web authoring techniques both in CSS and HTML, still-rampant use of IE6 hampers web development, and adds additional costs to any project that wants to look remotely similar.  Save the developers.  Ask your users to upgrade their browsers.

= What about IE7? =

Mildly better in that it supports PNG Transparency, but not by much.
